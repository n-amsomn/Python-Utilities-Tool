# Python Utilities Program

A simple Python program that at the moment can clean your downloads folder, recycle bin and other folders from your machine, also capable of dowloading frequently used installers to your downloads folder.
*NEW* Added a tool for folder sorting that supports adding and removing custom sorting rules!




## Usage/Examples
To run this script ensure you have Python 3.x installed and run the following commands to powershell:
```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
```


## Future Improvements

Plans to add more functions to the Script such as _folder sorting_ and email writing. There are also plans to migrate the downloader part to a Powershell script using Chocolatey for a wider range of programs and to remove the risk of the download links breaking.
